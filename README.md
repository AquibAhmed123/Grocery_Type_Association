## Grocery Type Association
Welcome to the Grocery Association in Machine Learning (GAML) project! This project aims to demonstrate how machine learning techniques can be applied to analyze grocery shopping data to uncover patterns, associations, and insights that can benefit both retailers and consumers. This README file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and instructions for using the provided code and resources.

## Project Overview
In the grocery retail industry, understanding customer behavior and product associations is crucial for optimizing inventory management, sales strategies, and customer satisfaction. GAML is a machine learning project designed to discover patterns and associations within grocery shopping data. The primary objectives of this project are:

Identify item associations: Determine which products are frequently purchased together to improve product placement and offer personalized product recommendations.
Market basket analysis: Analyze shopping baskets to understand customer preferences, such as common item combinations.
Predictive analytics: Utilize machine learning algorithms to predict future shopping behaviors and trends.
